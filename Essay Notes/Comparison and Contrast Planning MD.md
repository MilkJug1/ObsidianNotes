## Quotes

- Quote 1: *The 100*
  
  > Wells:    Mmph…
  > Bellamy:    Shh. Shh. That's far enough. I don't want to shoot you, Wells, hell, I like you, but I do need them to think that you're dead.
  > Wells:    Why? Why are you doing this, for real, not some crap about getting to do what you want to do?
  > Bellamy:    I have my reasons. I also have the gun. So I ask the questions, and the question is, why aren't you helping me? Your dad banished you, Wells, and yet here you are, still doing his bidding, following the rules. Aren't you tired of always doing what's expected of you? Stand up to him. Take off that wristband, and you'll be amazed at how good it feels.
  > Wells:    No. Never. Not gonna happen. Is that clear enough for you?
  > Bellamy:    Yeah. It is. I'm sorry it had to be this way.
  > Wells:    No! No! Get off of me! No!
  > Bellamy:    Get him down. Put him down.
  > Wells: No! Come on, man. Let me go.
  > Bellamy:    Get it. Do it.
  > Wells:    No! Don't do this! Don't do this! No. No! Come on, man. Aah!

> [!note]
> In this quote, Bellamy is using his weapon, like Jack did with his knife, in order to threathen Wells into forcing him to do something. Bellamy is already starting to become our Jack in this scene, how he is trying to be violent with him, how he inflicts pain onto him along with him bullying Wells because of Bellamy's disdain for Wells' dad.

 LOTF pg 164

> Presently they were all jabbing at Robert who made mock rushes.
> Jack shouted.
> “Make a ring!”
> The circle moved in and round. Robert squealed in mock terror, then in real pain.
> “Ow! Stop it! You’re hurting!”
> The butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them.
> “Hold him!”
> They got his arms and legs. Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric’s spear and jabbed at Robert with it.
> “Kill him! Kill him!”
> All at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy. Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife. Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.
> “Kill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!”
> Ralph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering. Jack’s arm came down; the heaving circle cheered and made pig-dying noises. Then they lay quiet, panting, listening to Robert’s frightened snivels. He wiped his face with a dirty arm, and made an effort to retrieve his status.

> [!INFO]
> Pay attention to how the group is attacking Robert, as if he was a pig. Look at how even if they were playing, they were still inflicting pain onto Robert for fun.

## Main points

- How both materials present the idea of human nature slowly becoming more savage when society has no rule.

- The way the characters act so similarity due to the effect the island is giving them.

- The notion of the effect of being changed from not being under society's rule and how it affects each character individually.


# Body paragraph II

> **Note**
> Stop using "we" and start using stuff that can fill in that blank, since this is an essay, no pronouns refrencing the reader.

### Topic Sentence of the first body paragraph

 Without the structure and grasp that society hold on us, we would devolve into savage, crazed beasts that kill people and things for fun. This happen a lot in both stories as it is evident that  multiple people get violently abused by the group of kids, and this happens especially in Lord of the Flies when it shows the group killing multiple people later in the story.

### Supporting Detail # 1

It is evident from both pieces of material that without the tight structure that society gives us, can and will make people slowly start to have their true nature and violent side/tendencies to eagerly come out.

 ### Text Evidence
> They got his arms and legs. Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric’s spear and jabbed at Robert with it.
> “Kill him! Kill him!”
> All at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy. Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife. Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.

> Expanded Detail of text evidence

- Here it is evident that this violent scene of the boys poking and jabbing Robert with sharp sticks and spears, is special because it shows the devolution of the group of kids in Lord of the Flies, something that will be evident later in "The 100".

- ### Supporting Detail # 2

The more time a single person is away from societal rule, and succumb to their violent tendencies, they will slowly start to lose parts of their built up identity. The more one kills, they will become numb from said killing after enough.

  > Callie Abby, what's wrong?
  > Abby The Chancellor has been shot.

  > Shumway:

  > I.D.ed the shooter. Bellamy Blake is the only person on
  > The Ark unaccounted for.
  > Kane: Who is he?
  > Shumway :He's no one, a janitor. We're still working up a profile, but his motive for going to Earth is clear.

  > *Later in the transcript*
  > Bellamy:    I have my reasons. I also have the gun. So I ask the questions, and the question is, why aren't you helping me? Your dad banished you, Wells, and yet here you are, still doing his bidding, following the rules. Aren't you tired of always doing what's expected of you?

#### Expanded detail of text evidence

- Just after the Chancellor got shot, the first recorded shed of blood in "The 100" that is seen, starts to show the downfall of the character Bellamy, who is the most closest to Jack in terms of personality and how they both act. This set up the next part where Bellamy is starting to threaten Wells into doing his bidding,
