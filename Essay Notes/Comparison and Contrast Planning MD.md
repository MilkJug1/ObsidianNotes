## Quotes 
- Quote 1: *The 100*
  
  > Wells:    Mmph…
  > Bellamy:    Shh. Shh. That's far enough. I don't want to shoot you, Wells, hell, I like you, but I do need them to think that you're dead.
  > Wells:    Why? Why are you doing this, for real, not some crap about getting to do what you want to do?
  > Bellamy:    I have my reasons. I also have the gun. So I ask the questions, and the question is, why aren't you helping me? Your dad banished you, Wells, and yet here you are, still doing his bidding, following the rules. Aren't you tired of always doing what's expected of you? Stand up to him. Take off that wristband, and you'll be amazed at how good it feels.
  > Wells:    No. Never. Not gonna happen. Is that clear enough for you?
  > Bellamy:    Yeah. It is. I'm sorry it had to be this way.
  > Wells:    No! No! Get off of me! No!
  > Bellamy:    Get him down. Put him down.
  > Wells: No! Come on, man. Let me go.
  > Bellamy:    Get it. Do it.
  > Wells:    No! Don't do this! Don't do this! No. No! Come on, man. Aah!

> **Note**
> In this quote, Bellamy is using his weapon, like Jack did with his knife, in order to threathen Wells into forcing him to do something. Bellamy is already starting to become our Jack in this scene, how he is trying to be violent with him, how he inflicts pain onto him along with him bullying Wells because of Bellamy's disdain for Wells' dad.
> This note will be used again, though shorted by a bit later in the body paragraphs as is seen below.


> Presently they were all jabbing at Robert who made mock rushes.
> Jack shouted.
> “Make a ring!”
> The circle moved in and round. Robert squealed in mock terror, then in real pain.
> “Ow! Stop it! You’re hurting!”
> The butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them.
> “Hold him!”
> They got his arms and legs. Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric’s spear and jabbed at Robert with it.
> “Kill him! Kill him!”
> All at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy. Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife. Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.
> “Kill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!”
> Ralph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering. Jack’s arm came down; the heaving circle cheered and made pig-dying noises. Then they lay quiet, panting, listening to Robert’s frightened snivels. He wiped his face with a dirty arm, and made an effort to retrieve his status.

> **Info**
> LOTF pg 164
> Pay attention to how the group is attacking Robert, as if he was a pig. Look at how even if they were playing, they were still inflicting pain onto Robert for fun.

## Main points

- How both materials present the idea of human nature slowly becoming more savage when society has no rule.

- The way the characters act so similarity due to the effect the island is giving them.

- The notion of the effect of being changed from not being under society's rule and how it affects each character individually.

~~- Due to how the stories are very similar in the way they handle characters and the de-evolution of the characters~~

# Topic Sentence of the ***first*** body paragraph

 Without the structure and grasp that society hold on us, we would devolve into savage, crazed beasts that kill people and things for fun. This happen a lot in both stories as it is evident that  multiple people get violently abused by the group of kids, and this happens especially in Lord of the Flies when it shows the group killing multiple people later in the story. *LIST LOTF 164 here*

### Supporting Detail # 1
It is evident from both pieces of material that without the tight structure that society gives us, can and will make people slowly start to have their true nature and violent side/tendencies to eagerly come out.


### Supporting Detail # 2
The more time a single person is away from societal rule, and succumb to their violent tendencies, they will slowly start to lose parts of their built up identity. The more one kills, they will become numb from said killing after enough. 

	- Text evidence w/page num
	 - (Transcript)

  > Callie Abby, what's wrong?
  > Abby The Chancellor has been shot.

  > Shumway:
  > Excuse me, sir. You asked to be notified if there was
  > news. The Chancellor is still in surgery, but we have
  > I.D.ed the shooter. Bellamy Blake is the only person on
  > The Ark unaccounted for.
  > Kane: Who is he?
  > Shumway :He's no one, a janitor. We're still working up a profile, but his motive for going to Earth is clear.

  > *Later in the transcript*
  > Bellamy:    I have my reasons. I also have the gun. So I ask the questions, and the question is, why aren't you helping me? Your dad banished you, Wells, and yet here you are, still doing his bidding, following the rules. Aren't you tired of always doing what's expected of you?

#### Expanded detail of text evidence

- Just after the Chancellor got shot, the first recorded shed of blood in "The 100" that is seen, starts to show the downfall of the character Bellamy, who is the most closest to Jack in terms of personality and how they both act. This set up the next part where Bellamy is starting to threaten Wells into doing his bidding,


### Transition Sentence
In both of these 2 pieces of of text shows that even though that both of the stories take place in entiretly different times, they both succumb very similar to man's savage nature, this could be in part of the island doing something to them or just
man's nature showing its true colors.

# Topic Sentence of the ***second*** body paragraph:
In the de-evolution of each character inside of the texts, it is evident that the island has had some form of an affect on the characters as if the island was a character, as it is described and talked about as one.


##  Supporting Point #1

When the kids in the "The 100" first got to the island, after a while its evident that all of the kids immediatly start to change rapidly due to the effects of the island, for example when the kids are writing that Wells will die(spelled as dye)
it starts to show the decline of the kids. This is more apparent when the kids start to become more cult-like.

  ### Text Evidence w/ page num:
  > Transcript, Scene 12 The camp
  > Murphy:	You know, my father, he begged for mercy in the airlock chamber when your father floated him.
  > Wells: 	You spelled die wrong, geniuses.
  >Bellamy:	If you're gonna kill someone, it's probably best not to announce it.
  >Murphy:	You're not really a member of the guard, are you?

  #### Expanded Detail of Text Evidence:
  This quote is showing that even though the kids had been on the island for a short period of time, they are starting to feel and succumb to the effect of the island and how it changes them.
  

## Supporting point #2
  Jack's transformation from a choir kid to a savage at the end of the book shows what the island has done to him.

  ### Text Evidence w/ Pg num:
  > Pg 41
  >“You cut a pig’s throat to let the blood out,” said Jack, “otherwise you
  > can’t eat the meat.”
  > “Why didn’t you—?”
  > They knew very well why he hadn’t: because of the enormity of the
  > knife descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood.
  > "I was going to," said Jack. He was ahead of them, and they could not see his face. "I was choosing a place. Next time --!"
  > He snatched his knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk. **Next time there would be no mercy**

  >**Note**
  > I italicized a part of that quote because it will be important once I start to write, since it shows and setups up something later in the book.

  > Pg 96-97
  > “Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood.”
  > Yet as the words became audible, the procession reached the steepest part of the mountain, and in a minute or two the chant had died away.
  > Piggy snivelled and Simon shushed him quickly as though he had spoken too loudly in church.
  > Jack, his face smeared with clays, reached the top first and hailed Ralph excitedly, with lifted spear.
  > “Look! We’ve killed a pig—we stole up on them—we got in a circle—”
  > Voices broke in from the hunters.
  > “We got in a circle—”
  >“We crept up—”
  >“The pig squealed—”

#### Expanded Detail of text evidence

  Both of these quotes show an entire 180 degree turn in Jack's character as a result of the island, we get told that Jack was a high ranking kid at school who was the leader of their school's choir, which that one little detail gives us an insight that Jack wouldn't be able to do something like this and to this scale without the island affecting him.
  This is more apparent when we look further into the story when Jack and the other savages are attacking the sow, even with this pig, both of the events are described in a way that start to shed the light onto the degration of the kids innocence, and identity.

### Transition Sentence

  From both stories, the island may have had an affect on the kids' mental wellbeing and more to get them to this state, it is not the sole reason for *why* they are starting to succumb to becoming savages.
  The island does have an affect on these kids, but not as much as some other stuff is factored into this.

# Topic Sentence of the ***Third*** body paragraph.
 







# Concluding Paragraph
It is evident that in both of the stories, that they both tell a very similar tale. In terms of settings, the actions of each kid and how they are affected from not being under society's rule and from the island, to just how the kids are changing by the minute. Though that both of these materials are a bit different in terms of certain things, like "The 100" is taking place after a nuclear fallout that lasted more than 90 years, their reasoning for coming back to Earth was to make sure that, A it was safe to come back, and B that they can survive since they were starting to run out of resources very quickly.
