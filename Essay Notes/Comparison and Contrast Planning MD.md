- Organizational strategy is a bit of both block and point to point.
- Main Thesis is:
   *LOTF & "The 100" both show the savage and barbaric side of human nature when the rules and structure of civilization are gone.*

> What are the 3 main points that will support your Main Idea/Thesis? (These should be previewed in your introduction and serve as paragraph ideas within the body of your paragraph)

- In both LOTF & the 100, the kids all had a similar mindset, how they were so native that they thought this was going to be a fun and relaxing adventure, but they eventually succumbed to the effects on the Island.
- The kids in "The 100", have very similar characteristics to their equivalent in LOTF
  - Think of how Bellamy is a lot like Jack, how Clarke is the most like Ralph, Wells is the most like Piggy, and so on.
- Though "The 100" takes place in the future, both stories, LOTF and "The 100", both have very similar beginnings.
- After a while, all of the kids in each LOTF and "The 100" are starting to slowly become into savages
  - Think about how violent Jack gets in the story to a point where he has a confirmed kill count of 2, and how cult-like the kids get in "The 100"

> Remember that nothing special has to be put down for the quotes for "The 100"

- Quote 1: *The 100*
  
  > Wells:    Mmph…
  > Bellamy:    Shh. Shh. That's far enough. I don't want to shoot you, Wells, hell, I like you, but I do need them to think that you're dead.
  > Wells:    Why? Why are you doing this, for real, not some crap about getting to do what you want to do?
  > Bellamy:    I have my reasons. I also have the gun. So I ask the questions, and the question is, why aren't you helping me? Your dad banished you, Wells, and yet here you are, still doing his bidding, following the rules. Aren't you tired of always doing what's expected of you? Stand up to him. Take off that wristband, and you'll be amazed at how good it feels.
  > Wells:    No. Never. Not gonna happen. Is that clear enough for you?
  > Bellamy:    Yeah. It is. I'm sorry it had to be this way.
  > Wells:    No! No! Get off of me! No!
  > Bellamy:    Get him down. Put him down.
  > Wells: No! Come on, man. Let me go.
  > Bellamy:    Get it. Do it.
  > Wells:    No! Don't do this! Don't do this! No. No! Come on, man. Aah!

> [!note]
> In this quote, Bellamy is using his weapon, like Jack did with his knife, in order to threathen Wells into forcing him to do something. Bellamy is already starting to become our Jack in this scene, how he is trying to be violent with him, how he inflicts pain onto him along with him bullying Wells because of Bellamy's disdain for Wells' dad.

LOTF pg 164

> Presently they were all jabbing at Robert who made mock rushes.
> Jack shouted.
> “Make a ring!”
> The circle moved in and round. Robert squealed in mock terror, then in real pain.
> “Ow! Stop it! You’re hurting!”
> The butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them.
> “Hold him!”
> They got his arms and legs. Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric’s spear and jabbed at Robert with it.
> “Kill him! Kill him!”
> All at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy. Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife. Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.
> “Kill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!”
> Ralph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering. Jack’s arm came down; the heaving circle cheered and made pig-dying noises. Then they lay quiet, panting, listening to Robert’s frightened snivels. He wiped his face with a dirty arm, and made an effort to retrieve his status.

> [!INFO]
> Pay attention to how the group is attacking Robert, as if he was a pig. Look at how even if they were playing, they were still inflicting pain onto Robert for fun.

## Main points

- How both materials present the idea of human nature slowly becoming more savage when society has no rule.

- The way the characters act so similarity due to the effect the island is giving them.

- The notion of the effect of being changed from not being under society's rule and how it affects each character induviually.

- Due to how the stories are very similar in the way they handle characters and the de-evolution of the characters

### Topic Sentence of the first body paragraph

 Without the structure and grasp that society hold on us, we would devolve into savage, crazed beasts that kill people and things for fun. We see this happen a lot in both stories as we can see multiple people get violently abused by a group of kids, and espcially in Lord of the Flies we see the group killing multiple people later in the story. *LIST LOTF 164 here*
